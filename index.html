<p>My name is Barrett Dodds and I was born and raised in Upstate, SC where I enjoy rock climbing, mountain biking, and working in the hospital system. My path led me to <a href="http://www.andersonuniversity.edu/">Anderson University</a> where I am currently pursuing a BSN-RN degree (in a 15-month <a href="http://andersonuniversity.edu/nursing/programs/accelerated-bachelor-science-nursing">Accelerated Program</a>).</p>

<p>On days that I'm not in school, I work at <a href="http://www.parksidepediatrics.com/">Parkside Pediatrics</a> where I provide direct care to patients, administer medication and vaccinations, and work in the certified lab running a multitude of tests. I plan to continue to work in the pediatric practice after graduation while pursuing a job as a Registered Nurse in a local hospital. I also plan to have a little fun in the great outdoors along the way.</p>

<a id="achievements" class="anchor" name="achievements" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Achievements</h3>

<p>Through my previous experiences and job opportunities I have learned how to prioritize, delegate, manage, and think critically in the medical field as well as in the management area in the automotive market. Learning how to prioritize what is MOST important in situations you are dealt to handle is absolutely a crucial skill to obtain.</p>

<p>I have learned how to delegate, especially in the hospital and Pediatric practice, by understanding my role as a nurse and how to properly and effectively communicate orders to staff while prioritizing which patient is most important.</p>

<p>In the automotive field I was able to learn how to manage tasks and people for the owner of the dealership. He would select me to manage more personal tasks that included car pick up and transfer to sister-dealership as well as warehouse organization and packing.

<p>Throughout all of theses experiences and current jobs, I have been able to effectively learn how to critically think in high pressure situations as well as keep a cool demeanor.</p>

<p>I have achieved the following certifications</p>
  <ul>
      <li>BSN-RN [Expected 2015]</li>
      <li>PEARS/ACLS/BLS</li>
      <li>IHI (Institute for Healthcare Improvement)- Certificate </li>
      <li>Certified Nursing Assistant license</li>
  </ul>

<p>Read below about my participation in international medical missions as well as outdoor activities.</p>

<p><strong>International Medical Missions</strong></p>

<p>This past March I was blessed with the opportunity to fly down to Nicaragua with a few classmates and several Nurse Practitioners. We met an incredible doctor down there named Ruben Lopez who had all of the connections and transportation that we needed.</p>

<p>Our team set up clinics in small villages outside of Managua. There we assessed, diagnosed, proscribed medicine, educated, and help teach about the Gospel of Christ. Each village we went to was more eye opening than the last; more and more families would come with such generosity and love toward us at the clinics. After a few days of clinics in the villages our group visited a children's hospital, specifically a cancer unit, where we gave out gifts and prayed with kids and their families. Many of the doctors and nurses at the hospital worked 24 hour shifts with little break time in between and were ecstatic that we could come play and comfort the families for a short time.</p>

<p>The people in Nicaragua left a huge impact in my worldview as well as my heart. They are some of the most loving, caring, and compassionate people I have ever had the pleasure to meet.</p>

<p>
  Here is a video that describes the experience visually:

  I also enjoy the great outdoors and actively rock climb and mountain bike. Here's are a few pictures of me rock climbing:
